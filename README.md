# New York City Motor Vehicle Collisions

This repository contains functionality for the front end of the application described at https://github.com/paul-tqh-nguyen/nyc_collision_map .

This repository is kept separate from the other functionality (data processing and data storage) in order to avoid GitHub pages building process issues that stem from the large amount of data used.
